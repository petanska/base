# Code best practices
## Filenames:
YYMMDD format
No capitalized letters, unless used to gap a whitespace, hyphen, commas
information words are separated by underscores
'model_210801_p300ChroMof_dilConvs_v3.file'

## Code:
' instead of "
131 characters per line
Write comment chunks in markdown format
Write first line of actual comments without whitespace '#comment'
and subsequent lines of the same comment with whitespace '# continued'
(This way the first line appears like a header to the naked eye)
start CAVEs with "#!comment" and open questions with "#?comment"
(this way they are super easy to grep for)

## Tables:
Column headers and strings must start with a letter
They should use capitalized letters to gap whitespaces, hyphens and commas
Information words should be separated by underscores
They must not contain special characters
The strings themselves should not need to be escaped
